Assessing creativity independently of language: A Language Independent Remote Associate Task (LIRAT)

Most creativity measures are either complex or language-dependent hindering cross-cultural creativity assessment. 
We have therefore developed and tested a simple, language-independent insight task based on pictures in the style of 
the widely used verbal remote associate task (RAT). We demonstrate that the language-independent RAT allows assessing 
different aspects of insight across large samples with different languages. It correlates with other creativity and 
general problem solving tasks. The entire stimulus set including its normative data is made freely available. 
This information can be used to select items based on accuracy, mean solution time, likelihood to produce an insight 
or conceptual and perceptual similarity between the pictures per item.
